# ⚙️ Algorithms Used
We explore and implement the following machine learning algorithms for disease prediction:

    -Random Forest
    -Decision Trees
    -K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    -Logistic Regression
Each algorithm is evaluated on its performance, and the one with the highest accuracy is selected.
